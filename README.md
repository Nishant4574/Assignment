## Website Performance Analysis

We analyzed website performance using visualizations. The bar graph compares **Page** and **Page Views**, showing the popularity of different pages. Additionally, the pie chart represents the **bounce rate**, giving insights into user retention. Pages with a high bounce rate might need optimization, while those with low bounce rates show better engagement. The average time spent on each page helps identify how engaging the content is. Together, these graphs offer a comprehensive view of website traffic, user behavior, and content effectiveness.

## Strategies to Increase Average Time Spent on Page

1. **Onboarding Page**  
   Implement an onboarding page that allows users to explore and review top-rated anime. This feature ensures a seamless experience on both the website and app, guiding users through the most popular content and encouraging them to delve deeper into the offerings.

2. **Manga Writer Showcase**  
   Display images of manga writers alongside their names below the manga content. This feature enhances user engagement by allowing readers to connect with the creators behind their favorite stories, fostering a sense of community and appreciation for the artists.
